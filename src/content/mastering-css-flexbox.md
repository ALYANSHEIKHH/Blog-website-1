Flexbox is a powerful CSS layout tool that allows for efficient alignment, distribution of space, and responsive layouts. In this guide, we'll cover the basics of Flexbox and how you can leverage it to build flexible, robust layouts in your projects.

## What is Flexbox?

[CSS Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) (Flexible Box Layout) is a CSS3 layout model designed to provide a more efficient way to arrange items within a container. Flexbox is ideal for both single-row and single-column layouts, offering flexibility and control over how elements are positioned, aligned, and spaced.

### Key Flexbox Concepts

- **Flex Container**: The parent element to which `display: flex` is applied, making it a flex container.
- **Flex Items**: Direct children of the flex container that follow the Flexbox rules for layout.

## Basic Flexbox Properties

### Display: Flex

Setting `display: flex` on a container makes it a flex container. This enables Flexbox layout within its children.

```css
.container {
    display: flex;
}

.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
}


.container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
}

<div class="container">
    <div class="box">1</div>
    <div class="box">2</div>
    <div class="box">3</div>
</div>
